# Extracting Imprecise Geographical and Temporal References from Journey Narratives (demo)

Previous approaches to understanding geographies in textual sources tend to focus on geoparsing to automatically identify place names and allocate them to coordinates. Such methods are highly quantitative and are limited to named places for which coordinates can be found, and have little concept of time. Yet, as narratives of journeys make abundantly clear, human experiences of geography are often subjective and more suited to qualitative representation. In these cases, "geography" is not limited to named places; rather, it incorporates the vague, imprecise, and ambiguous, with references to, for example, "the camp", or "the hills in the distance", and includes the relative locations using terms such as "near to", "on the left", "north of" or "a few hoursâ€™ journey from". 

In this demonstration repository, we present a series of Python notebooks which describe our research prototypes to extract and analyse qualitative and quantitative references to place and time in two corpora of English Lake District travel writing and Holocaust survivor testimonies.

## Code Documentation
The code for this demo uses a collection of functions that extract and visualize entities and semantic tokens from a given text. It was written by an anonymous author and utilizes the `Spacy` library for natural language processing, the `lemminflect` library for inflection and lemmatization, and the `re` library for regular expression matching.

This code is useful for anyone who needs to extract and visualize entities and semantic tokens from a given text.

### Functions
The functions in this code are stored in `functions.py` file and are described as below:

- `extract_entities(text, ent_list, tag='PLNAME')`: Generates a dictionary of entities with the indexes as keys based on a list of entities and the input text.

- `get_inflections(names_list)`: Gets inflections and lemmas of geo nouns.

- `combine_multi_tokens(a_list)`: Combines multiple adjacent semantic tokens.

- `extract_sem_entities(processed_text, tag_types)`: Generates a dictionary of semantic entities combining adjacent ones based on a list of semantic token types and a processed text.

- `merge_entities(first_ents, second_ents)`: Merges two entity dictionaries.

- `get_tagged_list(text, entities)`: Generates a list of all tokens, tagged and untagged, for visualization.

- `mark_up(token, tag=None)`: Marks up a token for visualization.

- `visualize(text, entities)`: Generates and returns HTML-formatted text with tagged entitities for visualization.
